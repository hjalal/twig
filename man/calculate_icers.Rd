\title{Calculate Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs)}
\usage{
calculate_icers(rewards_summary, col_names = c("cost", "utility"))
}
\arguments{
\item{rewards_summary}{A matrix containing the summary statistics of the rewards. It should have columns for cost and utility.}

\item{col_names}{A character vector specifying the names of the columns for cost and utility. Default is c("cost", "utility").}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item{Strategy}{The name of the strategy.}
\item{Cost}{The cost of the strategy.}
\item{Effect}{The effect (utility) of the strategy.}
\item{Inc_Cost}{The incremental cost compared to the next less effective strategy.}
\item{Inc_Effect}{The incremental effect compared to the next less effective strategy.}
\item{ICER}{The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio.}
\item{Status}{The dominance status of the strategy (ND = non-dominated, D = dominated, ED = extendedly dominated).}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) for a set of strategies based on their costs and effects.
