\title{Add an event layer to a twig object}
\usage{
event(name, options, probs, transitions)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{A character string representing the name of the event. It doesn't need to be quoted.}

\item{options}{A character vector of possible outcomes for the event. They don't need to be included in quotes. One of these options must be none.}

\item{probs}{A character vector of probability function names for each outcome. They don't need to be included in quotes. One of these can be leftover for the remaining probability.}

\item{transitions}{A character vector of state transitions corresponding to each outcome. They don't need to be included in quotes. These could be event names or states if a states layer defined.}
}
\value{
A list representing the event layer.
}
\description{
This function creates an event layer that can be added to a twig object. The event layer defines the possible outcomes of an event, their probabilities, and the transitions between states.
