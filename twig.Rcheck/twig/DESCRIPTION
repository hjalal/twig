Description: Provides tools for building decision and cost-effectiveness analysis models. It enables users to write these models concisely, simulate outcomes—including probabilistic analyses—efficiently using optimized vectorized processes and parallel computing, and produce results. The package employs a Grammar of Modeling approach, inspired by the Grammar of Graphics, to streamline model construction. For an interactive graphical user interface, see 'DecisionTwig' at <https://www.dashlab.ca/projects/decision_twig/>. Comprehensive tutorials and vignettes are available at <https://hjalal.github.io/twig/>.
